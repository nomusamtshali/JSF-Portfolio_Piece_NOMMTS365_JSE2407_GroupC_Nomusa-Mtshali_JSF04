# [JSF04] Project: Portfolio Piece

## Project Overview

- The Portfolio Piece project is a comprehensive e-commerce application built using Vue.js, showcasing a range of products, categories, and reviews. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, filter categories, and sort products by price. The project demonstrates my understanding of Vue.js, Vue Router, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia, as well as my ability to manage state, handle user authentication, and ensure responsiveness.


## Project Brief

1. Clone your JSF03 challenge and create a new repository, remember the naming convention: JSF-Portfolio_Piece_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF04

2. Fix any issues you had in JSF03.

3. Study and understand the extended user stories for the Portfolio Piece given on your dashboard rubric. The main user stories and presentation count for 119 points (85%)

4. Choose stretch goal/s that make up at least 21 points (15%), you are allowed to attempt more user stories but note that your final mark will be capped at 120% if you successfully complete user stories beyond the requirement.

5. Code your solution in Vue.js and document your code with JSDoc.

6. Commit changes to your GitHub repository.

7. Deploy your application in Vercel.

8. Use Zoom to record a 10 minutes video explaining the project and the code.

9. Upload the video recording to your YouTube channel.

10. Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set up the project, technologies used, link to your hosted application, link to your YouTube video

11. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

12. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote Github repository.

13. Submit your Github repository link on JSF04 project tab.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: A progressive and flexible JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows for a robust and maintainable codebase, making it ideal for complex applications.

- Vue Router: The official router for Vue.js, providing a robust and flexible way to manage client-side routing. Vue Router allows for seamless navigation between routes, making it easy to create complex applications.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization of web applications. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style HTML elements, making it easy to create consistent and visually appealing designs.

- Pinia: A lightweight and intuitive state management library for Vue.js, providing a simple and efficient way to manage application state.

- Fake Store API: A RESTful API providing a set of endpoints for fetching e-commerce data, such as products, categories, and reviews. The Fake Store API allows for easy integration with front-end applications, making it ideal for prototyping and testing.
